# Heart Disease Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting heart disease based on patient health characteristics. The dataset consists of structured medical data, and various machine learning models are applied to classify whether a patient has heart disease.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Model selection and training
- Performance evaluation using various metrics
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal results
- Final model testing and predictions

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab to execute the workflow step by step. The notebook contains detailed explanations of each step in the machine learning pipeline.

## Dataset
The dataset includes medical attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. These features are used to train a classification model.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC Curve

## Results
The final model achieves a high classification performance, making it suitable for heart disease prediction. Performance comparisons of different models are provided in the notebook.

## Future Improvements
